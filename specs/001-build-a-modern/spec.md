# Feature Specification: yt-dlp Web UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-modern`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a modern, user-friendly Web UI for a video/audio downloader tool using Spec Kit and Vibe Coding. The tool should wrap around yt-dlp functionality. Allow users to paste a YouTube (or similar) video URL and choose to download: Full video, Audio only (MP3 or WAV), Subtitles (if available), JSON metadata. UI Design Requirements: Rounded, modern interface with neumorphic or soft-shadow styles, Light theme with smooth transitions, Responsive layout with centered content and fluid width, Progress indicator during downloads, File format selectors as radio buttons or dropdowns, Download button with success/error feedback. Logic/Spec: Text input field for video URL, Radio/dropdown to choose format, Optional subtitle checkbox, Optional advanced toggle for cookies/proxy/output-template, Backend endpoint that invokes yt-dlp with appropriate flags, Show progress feedback, Allow user to download file after completion, Show download logs or error messages. Backend Specs: Language Python or Node.js, Safe command-line execution of yt-dlp with URL validation, Outputs stored temporarily and auto-deleted after X minutes, CORS + download response enabled. Extras: Display basic metadata preview before download, If subtitle checkbox selected save and display subtitle text, Drag & drop URL support."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to paste a video URL into a web interface and download the content in my preferred format (video, audio, or metadata) so that I can access the content offline without using command-line tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a valid YouTube URL, **When** they paste it into the URL input field and select "Video" format, **Then** the system should download the full video file and provide a download link
2. **Given** a user has a valid video URL, **When** they select "Audio (MP3)" format and click download, **Then** the system should extract and convert the audio to MP3 format
3. **Given** a user selects the subtitle checkbox, **When** they download a video, **Then** the system should also download available subtitles
4. **Given** a user selects "JSON metadata" option, **When** they submit a URL, **Then** the system should return video metadata without downloading the actual content
5. **Given** a user provides an invalid URL, **When** they attempt to download, **Then** the system should display a clear error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the video is private or region-restricted?
- How does the system handle very large video files that take a long time to download?
- What happens when the target website is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle URLs from unsupported platforms?
- What happens when subtitle files are not available for the requested language?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept YouTube video URLs
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate YouTube URL format before processing
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select download format: Video, Audio (MP3), Audio (WAV), or JSON metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time progress feedback during download operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST display download logs and error messages to users
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to download completed files through the web interface
- **FR-007**: System MUST support optional subtitle download when available
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user-configurable advanced options for cookies, proxy, and output templates
- **FR-009**: System MUST display basic video metadata (title, duration, thumbnail) before download
- **FR-010**: System MUST support drag-and-drop URL input
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically clean up temporary files after 24 hours
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle up to 5 concurrent download requests per user

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Download Request**: Represents a user's download request with URL, format selection, and options
- **Download Job**: Represents an active or completed download operation with status, progress, and file information
- **Video Metadata**: Contains video information (title, duration, thumbnail, available formats, subtitles)

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: Which platforms should be supported beyond YouTube? ‚Üí A: Only YouTube

- Q: What is the retention period for downloaded files? ‚Üí A: 24 hours
- Q: What is the maximum number of concurrent downloads per user? ‚Üí A: 5 concurrent downloads
